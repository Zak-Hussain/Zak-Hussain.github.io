## Bio

I am a researcher at the [Center for Cognitive and Decision Sciences](https://psychologie.unibas.ch/de/personen/zakir-hussain/about-me/) at the University of Basel, Switzerland, 
and a visiting researcher at the [Center for Adaptive Rationality](https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/person/127393/2549) at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin, Germany.

My research is at the intersection of cognitive science and machine learning, with a focus on the application of large language models (LLMs) to understand human cognition.  

I am also involved in educating behavioral and social scientists on how they can apply LLMs in their own research.
